                    I am Elijah Branner founder and president of SJDC robotics club,
                    I am in my first year of college and have already made a huge impact with the robotics
                    club.
                    I have managed to get plenty of students more active in the STEM field by providing them
                    with
                    projects so they can strengthen their skills. Despite my lack of experience due to age I am
                    a
                    strong
                    leader with a creative mind who is always looking to improve myself and others.

                    My name is Javier and I'm currently the VP of the robotics club. I've always held high interest in
                    artificial intelligence and robotics so joining and being a part of this club was a no-brainer. I am
                    also a CS major who loves the coding aspect of the discipline. My goal is to ultimately transfer to
                    SJSU, where I will continue my career goals. In the meantime, I plan to make an impact in this club
                    by being the VP and working with the president and other officers.
